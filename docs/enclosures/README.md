# Enclosures for Specter-DIY

There are a few case designs made by the community:

## SeedSigner's "Barebones" enclosure, v2

Updated design from @SeedSigner (Twitter/Telegram) with a smaller form factor & MicroSD access.
The printable .STL files are for sale for 20,000 sats (currently ~$7, price in sats will be adjusted as the dollar collapses against Bitcoin).
Barebones v1 is available for download from the docs/enclosures/seedsigner folder.
You can also buy it from [his shop](https://btc-hardware-solutions.square.site/)
